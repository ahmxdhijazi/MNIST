# MNIST
PyTorch project using the MNIST dataset â€” a classic collection of handwritten digits commonly used to train and test image classification models. This project is part of my journey to learn PyTorch, master the fundamentals of classification, and strengthen my technical ability to learn and adapt to new tools and frameworks.
